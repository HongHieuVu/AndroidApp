# AndroidApp

A calculator app for Android devices.

This app can recognize informally written equation, not demanding user to specify order of execution by explicitly placing open parentheses. In short, it can understand this:

3*(3log2+1)*sin3+2

without having the user specifically write this:

(3*((3log(2)+1)*sin(3)))+2

Also, there's an equation-solving mode, for those who are lazy. Just type in the equation, and the app would adjust its mode accordingly.
